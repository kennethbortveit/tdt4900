The diagnosis in the Action Research model is about identifying the nature of the problem situation, include all interrelated factors, develop a working theory about the situation and how it might be changed.  
\subsection{Situation Report}
The \gls{chd} at the Ministry of Health would like to make a system that will automatically generate reorder quantities of essential drugs to the \gls{chw}.
Based on SMS reporting from the \gls{chw}'s, the system will predict how much of each essential drug that are needed for the next delivery.
