\section{Defining success and failure}
\subsection{Categories}
As mentioned by Richard Heeks \cite{rh:isdc}, there are some ways of categorizing success and failure of information systems that I will use.
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Total Failure}] These system is either not implemented at all or implemented and abandoned shortly after.
\item[\textbf{Partial Failure}]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Significant undesirable outcomes.
		\item Major objectives unattained.
		\item Sustainability failure.
		\item Subjective goals unattained.
	\end{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Success}] Obtains objectives and no significant undesirable outcomes.
\end{description}
