\section{Day 3}
\subsection{Morning at the office}
I am still trying to figure out the requirements or wishes of HMIS.
Apparently there is not very much structure. No development cycle.
No requirements document. 
Randy proposed that we need to be able to implement an algorithm. 
But there is still no sign of the famous algorithm.
They don't know what they want I think.

\subsection{Testing}
I think we could start setting up the test environment and show what is possible so that they can see the opportunities.

\subsection{Setting up the test environment with sms}
This first time we will try with the SMS function in DHIS2.
We've encountered a bug in 2.12 after setting up the data elements.
The elements are there and connected to a data set.
While trying to browse the data elements it never stops loading.
Tried clearing cache, switch browser, update resource tables.
We will try to update the local version to new one, then start over.
Unfortunately I were told that we are the support, so I hope the HISP team in Oslo can help.

\subsection{Tasks}
I've got 2 tasks.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Make the requirements document for the system that is being made.
	\item Make the testing environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{End of the day}
Try one more time to set up the test environment for tomorrow.
The requirements document should be set up by 15th of March.

Got the backup from Randy and have to remember to run the analytic.
