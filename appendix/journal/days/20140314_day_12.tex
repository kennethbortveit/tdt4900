\section{Day 12}
The virtual server needs to be updated with the new Ubuntu.
Unfortunately this has taken about 2 days I think.
Don't know what the hold-up is.
\subsection{CHW supply chain meeting}
Today I probably holding a demo showing the use case 3 and 4.
Next week I will focus my attention on use case 1 and 2. 
If everything goes after plan, we should have everything ready in about 2 weeks.
I think there was a discussion around JSI which is a system like DHIS2. 
I don't know if this system is already in use or not.
