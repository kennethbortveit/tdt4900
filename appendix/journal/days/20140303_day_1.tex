\section{Day 1}
\subsection{Breakfast}
Missed on the time here today. Wrong time zone.
I thought the devices configured themselves, so I just trusted the watch.
Randy missed a part of his meeting because of that. 
Very embarrassing.
\subsection{MSH Office}
Got the first tasks. Should refine and define the requirements.
I don't see any problems just yet. A little unclear just who are the ones involved.
There are two guys, Patrick and Eric that i should meet with.
Both working with logistics I think, at least in stock management.
Haven't heard anything on the the SMPP protocol other than it should be there.
