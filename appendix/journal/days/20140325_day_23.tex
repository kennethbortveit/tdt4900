\section{Day 23}
\subsection{In the AM}
Alright, just broke off with Borah. Seemed to me like she had some other motives.
Quite convincing though.
I really like her though. 
Today I think I am going to continue on my application so that it will work with the GUI.
What else. 
I need to fix those requirements. Use case 3 and 4 is done.
2, the reminder, I can do through java.
1, the report should also be done through java if necessary.
And the product the user importer, for the MSH.

\subsection{DHIS2 interoperability MEMMS}

\subsection{Proposed meeting}
We will try to nail down the requirements tomorrow.
Maybe we need some other input as well.
