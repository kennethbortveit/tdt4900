\section{Day 8}
\subsection{Morning at the office}
Should be able to set up a local instance today.
It seems like it takes up much time to set up here.
I've been here for a week and still I am not able run a local instance.

Installing the software is somewhat difficult. Today I am getting this up and running.
Documentation should be better and easier.

I have not yet received a permanent seat to work at.

Gloria said that the data quality was so so.

Set up the testing for mobile reporting. It works, but I cant figure out how I set the received date.
