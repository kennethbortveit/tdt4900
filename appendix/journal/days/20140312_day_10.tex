\section{Day 10}
\section{Morning at the MoH/HMIS}
Today I will continue finishing the requirements document.
The en result should be something enumerated list with all the specifics.
Sent a draft of the requirements to all the people that wanted to know what is going on.

I think there will be some positive feedback.

I don't really know what I am about to gather data about just yet.
So any data generation methods are not appropriate yet.
