\section{Day 14}
Me and Borah took a little longer than expected yesterday.
I love being with her, but she spends a lot of money.
For me here it's still a lot. And she like says that I should give my money away.
Money in that direction is gone, no matter how much I spend.
Still, I like her. 
Maybe I'll see her later today.
We first took a cab from the hotel, don't remember it's name.
Then we took the bus from wherever we where back to Kigali.
The mountain we climbed was called Visoke. It is near where Dian Fossey made the documentary of the Silverbacks. We actually stayed at the same spot as she did, the hotel was the same and it was possible to rent her room.
