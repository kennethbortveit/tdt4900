\section{Day 30}
\subsection{Good morning}
Today is the meeting with Mike. 
Should design the codes and text for the Mobile Instance.
\subsection{After lunch}
Ok, we are on route I think.
Only thing missing now is the alerts.
I refer to the use cases.
Randy has skills in the query department. 
\subsection{Closing}
There is no culture for keeping appointments I think.
Had a no show this morning and a no show later this day.
This is not very likely to ensure future collaboration I think.
I think it is disrespectful and don't understand the need to waste time.
Think I will just say goodbye to any expectation I have from anybody.
At least not worry about it anymore.
Fuck it, don't care.
Hasta La Vista, Baby!
