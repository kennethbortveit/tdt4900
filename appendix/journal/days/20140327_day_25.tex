\section{Day 25}
Allright, seems like I've been living in Africa for a while.
Still typing allright wrong. I'll change it, alright. There we go.
So, back to the task at hand. After next week we are going to set up the DHIS2 instance.
I should probably make a painting here of the guys that are in on this, but I wont just yet.
To lazy to make a drawing. Now that I think about it, I want to draw on the computer.
Then again, then I will not draw on paper.
Kinda don't like that paper is going out. 
That would then be my hobby.
\subsection{VISA}
It is actually causing some stress for me that the VISA is not ready yet.
Don't really care what happens, it is just that it is not very usefull to not know where I am going to be for the next week. Specifying a country would actually make things a lot better.
\subsection{For my masters}
I really don't know what I will write about.
Thing is, there is not very much interesting that is worth mentioning.
I should send my supervisor an email.
Allright, damn, wrong again, alright. Sending the email.
Have no internet, so I will not send the email.
Can't really do much then, so I'll make some coffee and wait for Borah! 

Txt you later journal.

Kenneth

PS: This is my typing program. Which means, finally I don't have to look for anything else.
