\section{Day 32}
\subsection{Meeting with the clients}
I've got to know the clients yesterday.
I was also very tired today for some reason.
I basicly explained everything about the solution for Mike, Jean and Louis.
After explaining how shit works, we created some data elements, data sets, mobile sets and started the SMS service.
Everything went relatively fine.
Tried out a test SMS also.
Got some wierd questions that made somewhat frustrated.
The level here is not that good, but the that is not the problem.
The problem is that some people think they know what they are doing, but in reality they don't.
People that know that they can't is easy to teach, but it's harder to teach them who think they already understand.
After this session I ate lunch and went home to sleep.
I should mention that some people don't get that using custom made software might not work with future updates of DHIS2.
This may be a problem.
I should start collecting data as well as finishing the application.
