\section{Day 2}
\subsection{New Office}
Today we have a population count problem in DHIS2.
I would try to make a postgres query to check our implementation of DHIS2.
Got a temporary seat. Gloria is out in the field. 
Gloria is probably checking if the data is correct.
I am now at the HMIS's new office. 
Met, Venus again, Andrew, Adolph, Erick, Olive'something, and another. Got to get better on those names.
I think I'm a little further up the road from the old offices :).
\subsection{Beginning to collect the requirements}
It seems like the solutions should in some way be more effective.
I've been introduced to several people here.
