\section{Day 21}
This sunday was tiresome.
Did almost nothing. I should learn that I am useless after drinking.
I will not do anything. The sex with Borah was awsome, but I want to spend some time with her not in the room.
It would be better to like rent a room or something.
\subsection{Havanna}
We ate at the pizza place again. Four seasons was actually perfect.
Watched some tv and went to bed. Patricia got some visitor last night.
Maybe she is seeing someone :)
