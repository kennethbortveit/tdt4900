\section{Day 19}
Today I will find a way to import all the users into the database. 
A finished solution if you will.

\subsection{Before lunch}
Seems like we will start at the project next week.
In the mean time I will get this application started so that we can just import all the users.

I am very unsure on the technical level here.
