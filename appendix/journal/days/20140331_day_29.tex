\section{Day 29}
\subsection{Good morning}
I am working on getting a average consumption by month.
Not really getting a instant gratification from DHIS2.
This is what we are trying to achieve.
\subsection{Just got lunch}
This is beyond stupid. I've just realized that being here is almost a total waste of time.
There is no collaboration here. Just a bunch of people meeting from time to time.
I don't feel like being part of a team here.
Anyways, I will try to make the last 3 months from the web api.
This must be the least user friendly shit I've seen in a long time.
Returns nothing, that's its strength.
What the fuck is going on here?
