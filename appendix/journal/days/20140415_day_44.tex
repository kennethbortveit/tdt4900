\section{Day 44}
\subsection{Crazy Office Times}
This day of age is crazy.
What is up, really.
I have now developed an application that I hope will be of some use to the HMIS.
I have not yet decided if I should buy the SMPP protocol or not.
I want to, just to say that sometimes, money is the problem, and it is just one of those problems that has to be solved in order to get things done.
Just like everything else. So, now what. Should I start on the next application or should I start finishing of things here.
A little to do list here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Write a report to the MSH.
\item Upload users to the mobile instance.
\item Collect some data doing interviews.
\item Collect documents.
\end{itemize}
I will not buy the SMPP protocol. That's it.
I am done and will not push this forward anymore.
I meet more and more trivial problems and experience to much misery and frustration by doing this.
Thing is, I don't want to be the one sorting out everything.
I want to work with people that actually want to get something done.
I am curious of what I am going to write about, but time will tell.
I will get everything in order.
