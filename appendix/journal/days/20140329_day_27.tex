\section{Day 27}
The previous Saturday was awesome. Early mortning, rise and shine at 4AM. 
The hotel was perfect, the events were perfect.
Nothing to complain about.
\subsection{Chimps}
First me and Judith went to see the chimps.
It was alright. Very funny when the chimps started to scream and run around.
\subsection{Kanalope walk}
We walked over some bridge that hang in the air.
This was probably the coolest thing to this date!
\subsection{Dinner}
Perfect dinner, a little wierd. I think I was tired. It's strange, I don't feel it myself.
I can like analyze it later that it could be that. But I don't want to excuse myself for being the way I am. It's like people are looking for a reason to explain why I am the way I am.
For real, I would rather just stay quiet than succumb to this.
