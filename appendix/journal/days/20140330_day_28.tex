\subsection{Breakfast}
Slept almost as long as I wished. 
I were kind of in a hurry because Judith called and asked were I was.
So I were in a hurry.
Didn't like that to much, disappointed in myself in a way.

Singing, joking and in a way just having alot of fun :)

Met with Borah for dinner again.
It was very nice. Talked a little, she asked if I fucked or kissed anybody, was kind of fun :)
Probably since I didn't.
