\section{Day 13}
We climbed Visoke this day and I had some good sex.
Borah is like very open about sex. I get a boner just thinking about her.
Love it. She was like, "take it baby, take it". Just awsome.
It's like she's giving something away. I really don't understand why, but that's the way she sees it.
Probably the way all girls sees it. 
The more I try to define it the more difficult it gets. 
So, we boys are apparently trying to take the girls vagina.

That is what they are thinking. We are trying to get it.
I am thinking that girls should give it if they want to. 
I don't want be with them if they don't really want to. 
It not like it is a competition of trying to get something.
It's enjoying the time we spend together. Sex is definitely a part of that.
