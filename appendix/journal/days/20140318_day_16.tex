\section{Day 16}
Allright. I'm a little puzzled by the update at the national data center.
Still there is no real reason for why this is happening.
Also, the requirements should clearly be stated in some computer language like UML.
I came here with the impression that what was actually needed was described in UML or the like.
Fortunately there were some description of what is happening, but very little.
Proper documentation is obviously a key piece in order to get an overview of things.
UML FTW!
My bad, the virtual server is now up and running.
It is a little unclear if the users are actually the HMIS or the CHW. 
We'll see.
I should mention in my report the process of defining the requirements.

It is a lot of noise here from the outside.

\subsection{After lunch}
I will install Ubuntu on Edith's computer later. 
It seems like she wants to learn, which is positive.
I have to restore my database so that we can find out what exactly is the motherfucking fuckup that is happening.
In order to use this database I need a user I think. Maybe I can change the user password by accessing the database and give the right user rights. Probably.
Eric is making the letter so that we have confirmation from the university.


I was told before I left that the whole team is in on this. But we have not yet had a meeting for how we will proceed. This is exhausting. And my driver is driving me crazy.
