\section{Day 4}
\subsection{Morning}
The driver was about 20 minutes late. My goal was to be at the offfice by 08:00.
Maybe I should arrange for some other transportation arrangements.

\subsection{Before lunch}
Will continue with trying to set up the testing environment and defining the requirements.
I have a new database instance and a new database.
If this works, everybody can probably learn how to do this locally, so that testing can get done much faster.
Venuste and I should be able to set up the same system.
We did not manage to set up the database. Got several error messages.
"psql:healthfinance2014.sql:3450210: ERROR:  role "hfreadonly" does not exist"
\subsection{After lunch}
I am still waiting for Randy to arrive so that he can describe the algorithm to Ola.
I am really just sitting here doing nothing. 

\subsection{end of work day}
I think we've had a very productive day.
We've got a description of the algorithm and are trying to set up the testing environment.
Tomorrow I will continue setting up a local instance of DHIS2 with Venuste.
