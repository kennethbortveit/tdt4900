\subsection{Morning}
Heard that we've got the signature for the SMPP protocal last night.
Eric advised me to take notice of that basic knowledge and the difference between '0' and 'o', '1' and 'l' are important. It seems like touch is neither used. Wich is the most basic thing in computers.
There is alot that is not mentioned in the docuementation in DHIS2. Like how we should go about installing on a Windows machine. This might be a reason why this is not as widespread as it should be.
A little note for reasearch is that communication is not the way I am used to.
I am sitting very much alone without being very involved in what everyone else is doing.
I think I am in the loop, but it seems like everyone is working on separete things and just reporting to each other. 
I don't know why, but we are still missing that signature that allows us to use the SMPP protocol.
