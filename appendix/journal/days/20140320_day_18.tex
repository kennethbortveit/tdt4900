\section{Day 18}

\subsection{Morning}
I maybe think I am a little hard to please.
To much complaining I think. 
Today I will probably teach Venuste how to use postgres.

\subsection{Importing Users with Postgres}
This did not happen as it supposed to. We agreed that we should meet at 09:00AM, but apperantly there was another meeting that was more important to Venuste. No point in setting time if one just books over anyway.

\subsection{Generating passwords}
In order to generate passwords we need to have access to an algorithm. 
This is touching on some security issues I think.
I understand why it is this way. The security should be better i believe.
Alright. The password should be contain 8 characters, one capital letter and a number.

\subsection{Made the Password App}
My first executable java program :) password\_encoder!
That is awsome :)
