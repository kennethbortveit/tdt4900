\section{Day 5}
\subsection{Before lunch}
Forgot my charger today.
We are still trying to set up a local instance.
First we had to reinstall a new operating system on Venustes computer.
Now we are trying to install postgres so that we can install the database.
Venuste proposed that we do not install a DHIS2 instance on all of the computers.
