\section{Day 6}
\subsection{Getting TV}
We went to the city to acquire a tv subscription.
Patricia knows a guy. We got it for 60k a month.

\subsection{Market}
We shopped at Namukat. Probably the best place for getting supplies here in Kigali.
Bought bread from a different store some reason.

\subsection{Hash}
To of the girls got their names today. One is called bend, the other over.
It was the international womens day, so one old lady did not like the names.
We met at Chez Lando and started running from the facebook pub.

\subsection{Casino}
I got to drunk. I got this note from this girl, Kayli. She is saying she wants to meet.
I started out thinking it was not such a good idea, but later I got curios.
Was afraid she might set up a kidnapping or something.
She is a little bit religious I think.
