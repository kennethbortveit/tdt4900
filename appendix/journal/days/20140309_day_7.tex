\section{Day 7}
\subsection{Waking up}
Got up around 10:00 today.
Did nothing but some texting with Kayli.

\subsection{Night time}
I should remember to bring along Venustes charger tomorrow. It's in my backpack already.
It would be good to continue some on my thesis. Aiming for delivery before 1. July so that I can focus on my other courses.

Would be just perfect if I got finished this summer.
